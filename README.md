# STOCK ANALYSIS WITH VBA + EXCEL

## OVERVIEW: VBA Stock Analysis Project

### Background
Steve loves the workbook you prepared for him. At the click of a button, he can analyze an entire dataset. Now, to do a little more research for his parents, he wants to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. Although your code works well for a dozen stocks, it might not work as well for thousands of stocks. And if it does, it may take a long time to execute.

In this challenge, you’ll edit, or refactor, the Module 2 solution code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information that you did in this module. Then, you’ll determine whether refactoring your code successfully made the VBA script run faster. Finally, you’ll present a written analysis that explains your findings.

Refactoring is a key part of the coding process. When refactoring code, you aren’t adding new functionality; you just want to make the code more efficient—by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read. Refactoring is common on the job because first attempts at code won’t always be the best way to accomplish a task. Sometimes, refactoring someone else’s code will be your entry point to working with the existing code at a job.

### Purpose
For this project, we are working with the stock market dataset using the VBA solution code to loop through all the data in order to collect the entire dataset. Then we move on to determine whether refactoring the code would run the VBA script faster.

## Analysis and Challenges
conclusion is that refratoring the code successfully made the VBA script run faster.

Summary

What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?


The advantages of refracting code is that it is able to use a lot less memory, which helps control more data at a time. Another advantage is that it requires a lot less steps to make the code a lot more effective, which saves time. It is also very user friendly as it makes the code include logic and common sense to help understand it. 


As for every thing there are disadvantages for this the disadvantages are that the application is big and that in turn can have some bugs which is risky, different than the other code which includes ways to be able to test and figure out what is wrong to fix it. If the original code is not available it makes it hard to understand.

How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

Refactoring the original VBA script resulted in a more efficient program that enabled the results to be produced faster. As for this challenge we can see that the dataset was not very large which did not show a lot in the time difference of the runs, but when the dataset is a lot bigger it will result in significant time different for each of the runs. So, people working on larger sets of data it will be worth to refracting the script as it will help produce faster results which is needed.
